# php-3-pseudo-api

Basically I tried (with out env file) to develop a pseudo API. On my last internship the structure was very similar to it and today I thought about if I could do something similar, but better in terms of
smaller size, readability and overral improvement.
I'd thank a lot for feedback to improve it really well.
